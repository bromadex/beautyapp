# BeauTap — Development Roadmap

> Agreed plan based on brainstorm review — July 2026
> Tightened with Kimi review — July 2026
> Stack: Flutter + Supabase | Target: Zimbabwe (mobile-first)

## Locked Decisions

| Decision | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| App name | BeauTap |
| Home screen | Two separate files — `ClientHomeScreen` + `ProviderHomeScreen` |
| Admin nav | Option B — button from home screen, no dedicated shell |
| Launch categories | Hair only (add Makeup in month 2 after 50+ bookings) |
| Client activation fee | $1 one-time — "Unlock unlimited bookings" |
| Subscription model | First Booking Free → then $10/mo Active tier |
| Payment gateway | Paynow Zimbabwe (EcoCash, OneMoney, Telecash, Cards) |
| Navigation | Bottom nav with ShellRoutes, separate client/provider shells |
| Escrow | Deferred — build only after Paynow is live + 50 paid bookings |
| Multi-category | Deferred — Hair only at launch, expand after product-market fit |
| Reporting & Flagging | Deferred — basic admin tools are enough for now |

---

## Phase 1: Ship Mobile (Weeks 1-3)

### Stage 16: Navigation Overhaul

**Goal:** Fix routing crashes, add bottom nav, split home screen.

**Changes:**
- Split `home_screen.dart` into `client_home_screen.dart` and `provider_home_screen.dart`
- Build `ClientShell` with bottom nav: Home | Browse | Bookings | Favourites
- Build `ProviderShell` with bottom nav: Home | Bookings | Earnings | Profile
- Convert router to use `ShellRoute` for persistent bottom nav
- Add `/` redirect to `/home` (fixes `GoException: no routes for /`)
- Fix all `context.go()` vs `context.push()` misuse on sub-screens
- Admin access: icon button in provider home app bar → `/admin/dashboard`
- Role-based routing: after login, route to correct shell based on `user_type`

**Bottom Nav Structure:**

```
ClientShell (bottom nav)
├── /home              → ClientHomeScreen (discovery, categories, search)
├── /browse            → BrowseScreen
├── /client/bookings   → ClientBookingsScreen
│   └── /booking/:id   → pushes on top (no bottom nav)
│       ├── /chat/:bookingId
│       ├── /payment/:bookingId
│       ├── /tracking/:bookingId
│       └── /review/:bookingId
└── /favorites         → FavoritesScreen

ProviderShell (bottom nav)
├── /home              → ProviderHomeScreen (dashboard, metrics, next booking)
├── /provider/bookings → ProviderBookingsScreen
│   └── /booking/:id   → pushes on top
│       ├── /chat/:bookingId
│       └── /tracking/:bookingId
├── /earnings          → ProviderEarningsScreen
└── /provider/profile  → Profile hub
    ├── /provider/profile/edit
    ├── /provider/services
    ├── /provider/gallery
    ├── /provider/promotions
    └── /provider/subscription

No Shell (full screen):
├── /login
├── /register
├── /verify
├── /verify/pending
├── /notifications
├── /recommended
├── /admin/*
└── /provider/:id (public profile)
```

**Back Button Rules:**
- Sub-screens: `context.pop()` → returns to parent tab
- After payment/review/booking: `context.go()` to relevant bookings tab
- Login → home: `context.go('/home')` clears auth stack
- Logout: `context.go('/login')` — clears shell and entire nav stack, no back navigation to authenticated screens

**Root redirect (`/`):**
- `/` redirects based on auth + role: not logged in → `/login`, provider → `/home` (ProviderShell), client → `/home` (ClientShell)
- Fixes `GoException: no routes for /` crash

**Files to create:**
- `lib/screens/client_home_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/provider_home_screen.dart`
- `lib/widgets/client_shell.dart`
- `lib/widgets/provider_shell.dart`

**Files to modify:**
- `lib/router.dart` — full rewrite with ShellRoutes
- `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` — split into two, then delete or keep as redirect

---

### Stage 17: App Rebrand — BeauTap

**Goal:** New identity across the entire app.

**Important sequencing:** Do the rebrand AFTER the first debug APK works (Stage 18). If the APK build breaks, you'll know whether it's the rebrand or the mobile build itself. **Exception:** Change package name to `com.beautap.app` immediately in Stage 17a — this is irreversible once published to Play Store, so set it early.

**Stage 17a (before APK):**
- Change package name to `com.beautap.app` (Android `build.gradle` + manifest)

**Stage 17b (after APK proven working):**

**Color Palette:**
| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Primary | Deep Rose | `#C2185B` |
| Secondary | Warm Gold | `#F9A825` |
| Background | Soft Cream | `#FFF8F0` |
| Surface | White | `#FFFFFF` |
| Text | Rich Black | `#1A1A1A` |
| Success | Mint | `#4CAF50` |
| Error | Coral Red | `#E53935` |

**Changes:**
- Update `lib/theme.dart` — new AppColors, gradients, AppTheme
- Update app name everywhere: `pubspec.yaml`, `index.html`, Android `strings.xml`
- Update all hardcoded "Beauty Home Services" strings to "BeauTap"
- Add tagline: "Beauty at your fingertips"
- Splash screen: Deep Rose background + white BeauTap text (using `flutter_native_splash`)
- App icon: placeholder until logo asset provided (using `flutter_launcher_icons`)

**Files to modify:**
- `lib/theme.dart` — full color/theme rewrite
- `pubspec.yaml` — app name + splash/icon packages
- `web/index.html` — title, theme color, manifest
- `android/app/build.gradle` — applicationId → `com.beautap.app`
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` — app label
- `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` — app name
- Every screen referencing "Beauty Home Services" in text

**Packages to add:**
```yaml
flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.14.x
flutter_native_splash: ^2.x
```

---

### Stage 18: APK Build

**Goal:** Working debug APK on a real Android phone.

**Note:** Same Flutter codebase — this is a cross-platform project, not a separate mobile project. `flutter build apk` compiles from the same `lib/` source. Web-specific packages (e.g., `flutter_web_plugins`) are conditionally imported and don't break APK builds.

**Pre-build checklist:**
- Package name set to `com.beautap.app` (done in Stage 17a)
- App icon configured (placeholder OK)
- Splash screen configured
- Min SDK set to 21 (Android 5.0+)
- All required permissions in AndroidManifest.xml:
  - `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`
  - `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`
  - `CAMERA`
  - `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
  - `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`
  - `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` (required for GPS tracking — "I'm On My Way" feature)

**Build commands:**
```bash
flutter build apk --debug          # for testing
flutter build apk --release        # for beta distribution
flutter build apk --split-per-abi  # smaller APKs per architecture
```

**Testing plan:**
- Install on own phone
- Complete full booking flow end-to-end
- Test GPS/location on mobile (native GPS differs from browser geolocation — different accuracy and permission flows)
- Test camera for verification
- Test back button behavior on every screen
- Test app kill + reopen (session persistence)
- Test "I'm On My Way" button — browser geolocation vs native GPS may behave differently
- Give APK to 1-2 friends, watch them use it
- Fix all mobile-specific bugs found

## Phase 2: Real Money (Weeks 4-6)

### Stage 19: Client Activation Fee ($1)

**Goal:** One-time $1 payment gate after verification approval.

**Flow:**
```
Register → Verify identity → Admin approves → $1 activation wall → Full access
```

**Gate logic:**
- Not verified → verification wall
- Verified + not activated → $1 payment wall
- Verified + activated → browse and book freely

**DB changes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_activated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
UPDATE profiles SET is_activated = true; -- grandfather existing accounts
```

**Files to create:**
- `lib/screens/activation_screen.dart` — payment UI with clear "one-time" messaging

**Files to modify:**
- Router — add activation check redirect
- Booking screen — gate check before allowing booking

**Note:** Initially uses simulated payment. Replaced by Paynow in Stage 20.

---

### Stage 20: Real Payments — Paynow Zimbabwe

**Goal:** Replace simulated payments with real EcoCash/Card payments.

**Architecture:**
```
Flutter → Supabase Edge Function → Paynow API → USSD push / Card page
Paynow webhook → Edge Function → DB update → Realtime → Flutter
```

**Edge Functions to build:**
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `initiate-payment` | Creates Paynow transaction, returns redirect/mobile prompt |
| `paynow-webhook` | Receives result, verifies signature, updates DB |
| `check-payment-status` | Polls Paynow status (fallback if webhook delayed) |

**What Paynow covers:**
- Service booking payments (EcoCash / OneMoney / Telecash / Card)
- $1 client activation fee
- Provider subscriptions

**DB changes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE payments
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS gateway TEXT DEFAULT 'paynow',
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS gateway_ref TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS webhook_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS currency TEXT DEFAULT 'USD';
```

**Security rules:**
- Never call Paynow from Flutter directly
- API keys only in Edge Function secrets
- Webhooks verified server-side with idempotency keys
- Retry logic on Edge Functions

**External dependencies:**
- Paynow merchant account registration (paynow.co.zw)
- Sandbox Integration ID + Key (available immediately — start sandbox integration early in this stage, don't wait for production credentials)
- Production credentials (after merchant approval, 2-4 weeks)

**Edge case:** Paynow USSD push requires the client's phone to be on the same network as their mobile money account. If the client is on WiFi with no SIM data, the USSD push may fail. Test this scenario and show a clear fallback message.

**Files to modify:**
- `lib/screens/payment_screen.dart` — replace simulation with real Paynow flow
- `lib/screens/subscription_screen.dart` — Paynow payment only
- `lib/screens/activation_screen.dart` — Paynow payment

---

### Stage 21: Subscription Revamp — First Booking Free

**Goal:** New subscription model tied to proven value.

**Provider journey:**
```
1. Create profile → FREE
2. Clients can browse and message → FREE
3. Accept first booking → FREE (no subscription needed)
4. First booking completes → prompt: "Subscribe to keep accepting bookings"
5. Subscribe to Active ($10/mo) → full access continues
```

**Tiers:**
| Tier | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **New** | Free | Profile visible, messaging, accept 1st booking |
| **Active** | $10/mo | Unlimited bookings + gallery + promos |
| **Featured** | $25/mo | Top 3 search placement + promo tools (limited slots) |

**Featured tier scarcity:** Max 3 Featured providers per area. If all slots taken, waitlist. This keeps "priority in search" genuinely valuable.

**Featured tier "area" definition:** Uses the provider's set service radius from Stage 6B GPS Tracking. Already in the DB, user-configurable, matches how clients search. Dense areas (Harare CBD, 5km) have more competition for slots; sparse areas (rural, 50km) have less. If provider hasn't set a radius, default to 10km with a nudge: "Set your service area to unlock Featured placement."

**Upgrade flow:** Provider upgrades from Active → Featured instantly if slots available. If all 3 slots in their area are taken, they join a waitlist and get notified when a slot opens (e.g., a Featured provider downgrades or moves area).

**DB changes:**
- Update `subscriptions` table to support new tier structure
- Add `first_booking_used` boolean to `provider_profiles`
- Subscription check: allow booking acceptance if `first_booking_used = false` OR `subscription.status = 'active'`
- Add `featured_waitlist` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE featured_waitlist (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  provider_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  requested_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  notified_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'waiting' CHECK (status IN ('waiting', 'notified', 'expired', 'activated')),
  UNIQUE(provider_id)
);
```

**Files to modify:**
- `lib/screens/subscription_screen.dart` — new tier UI
- Booking acceptance logic — first-booking-free gate
- Browse/search — Featured providers at top

---

## Phase 3: Public Launch (Weeks 7-8)

### Stage 22: Push Notifications — FCM (Basic)

**Goal:** 4 critical notification triggers via Firebase Cloud Messaging.

**Priority triggers only:**
1. New booking request → Provider
2. Booking confirmed → Client
3. New chat message → Recipient
4. 1-hour booking reminder → Both

**All other triggers deferred** (payment received, review, subscription expiry, promo alerts).

**Architecture:**
```
DB event → Supabase Edge Function → FCM HTTP v1 API → Device
```

**1-hour reminder requires `pg_cron`:** Triggers 1-4 are event-driven (DB insert/update fires Edge Function), but the 1-hour reminder needs a scheduled job. Use Supabase `pg_cron` extension to run a query every 15 minutes that finds bookings starting in 45-75 minutes and sends reminders via Edge Function. Mark bookings as reminded to avoid duplicates.

**DB changes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS fcm_token TEXT;
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reminder_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

**Flutter packages:**
```yaml
firebase_core: ^2.x
firebase_messaging: ^14.x
```

**External dependencies:**
- Create Firebase project
- Add Android app → `google-services.json`
- Add Web app → config in `index.html`
- Generate VAPID key for web push
- FCM Server Key in Supabase Edge Function secrets

**Permission flow:** Custom dialog on first login (1-2s delay), max 3 prompts then stop asking.

---

### Stage 23: Play Store Submission

**Goal:** BeauTap on Google Play Store.

**Pre-submission:**
- Release APK signed with production keystore
- All mobile bugs fixed from Phase 1 testing
- Privacy policy page
- App screenshots (5-8)
- Feature graphic (1024x500)
- Short + full description

**Signing:**
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore beautap.keystore \
        -alias beautap -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
flutter build appbundle --release
```

**Distribution path:**
1. Internal testing track → team testing
2. Closed testing → 20 beta providers
3. Open testing → public beta
4. Production → full launch

**Cost:** $25 one-time Google Developer account fee.

---

## Phase 4: Scale (After Launch)

These are deferred until the app has real users and real bookings:

| Stage | What | When |
|-------|------|------|
| 24 | Multi-Category (add Makeup) | After 50+ Hair bookings |
| 25 | Reporting & Flagging | After 100+ users |
| 26 | Escrow Payments | After Paynow live + dispute cases |
| 27 | Variable Subscriptions (per category) | After 2+ categories live |
| 28 | Advanced FCM (all 15 triggers) | After basic FCM proven |
| 29 | iOS Build | After Android stable + revenue |
| 30 | Loyalty & Rewards | After repeat booking data |
